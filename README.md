CNN model for event classification, energy and vertex reconstruction on SND@LHC data
Energy Reconstruction
Convolution neural network was trained as regressionmodel to reconstruct the enrgy of neural current and charged current interactions of neutrinos
Vertex Reconstruction
CNN model was used for vertex reconstruction of neutrino interactions.
