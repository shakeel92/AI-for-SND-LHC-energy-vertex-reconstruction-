CNN model for event classification, energy and vertex reconstruction on SND@LHC data
## Energy Reconstruction
Convolution neural network was trained as regression model to reconstruct the enrgy of neural current and charged current interactions of neutrinos
## Vertex Reconstruction
CNN model was used for vertex reconstruction of neutrino interactions.
## Event Classification
